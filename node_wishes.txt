things I like to see in node
making developer aware if their streams are properly closed and are not taking up memory and are not affecting the system in a significant way when not in use

express doesn't want me to use process.on('uncaughtException') to shut things down is this an internal problem or a logic problem or else how do I handle async errors that have nothing to handler their erros with like
ex.
	
	y = i+ 7// ERR i is undefined

if we had an general ErrorHandler object in node  async code would be so much easier
