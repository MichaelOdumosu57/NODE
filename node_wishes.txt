things I like to see in node
making developer aware if their streams are properly closed and are not taking up memory and are not affecting the system in a significant way when not in use

express doesn't want me to use process.on('uncaughtException') to shut things down is this an internal problem or a logic problem or else how do I handle async errors that have nothing to handler their erros with like
ex.
	
	y = i+ 7// ERR i is undefined

if we had an general ErrorHandler object in node  async code would be so much easier 	

n linux 16.04.5 the a,c,m, and birth time(Ms)? are reported wrong notify the developer about this 

also express.static uis not working

which I can see what my terminal see with some express objects in the v8 debugger

writeStream.drain should returns false or true why are they different for the same stream
